\maketitle
The following interview questoins are all from the REAL interviews(including both telephone and on-site interviews). Hope this document is helpful during your job hunting process. Enjoy!
\section{MS SQL Server and T-SQL}
Q: \underline{If the SQL performance is bad, tell me how you can fix it?} \newline
A: This is a typical and difficult question. Usually the SQL in the production database meets some performance trouble. The quickest way is to check the statistics of the related tables(You can find the table list from the SQL code), and update the statistics very quickly. If the statistics are updated, in most case, MS SQL Server will find the best execution plan by itself, and the trouble is fixed. However, if you do not see any performance improvement after you update the statistics of all tables, then you need to capture the execution plan from the memory(The SQL is still running/hung there, so you can easily extract the real execution plan from the memory) and compare it with the old execution plan. MS SQL Server store the old execution plan in the database. If the execution plan is changed, then you can use the old but good execution plan to apply on the current SQL. As the last resort, you should review the SQL code and rewrite it, or add some hints in the code. This is the basic idea about how to trouble shoot the SQL performance issue in the production database.\newline \newline
\noindent 
Q: What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in T-SQL? \newline \newline
\noindent 
Q: What is CTE? What is CTE can do but normal T-SQL cannot do?\newline \newline

\noindent 
Q: \underline{What is the size of the database you haved worked on?} \newline
A: It depends on the type of the database. We have three database types: OLTP(Online Transaction Processing) database, ODS(Operational Data Store) database, EDW(Enterprise Data Warehouse) database. OLTP: 500 GB - 3 TB; ODS: 10 TB - 60 TB; EDW: 5 TB - 30 TB. OLTP is much smaller, and the biggest one is ODS because it contains all the history raw data for many years.\newline \newline
